# Project ALPHA


## Overview
This project is aimed at creating a 24/7 monitoring system that finds and analyses various tokens for finding potential runners. Initial coins are found through various dexes or tracking whale wallets. It then goes through a series of checks to determine if it is a safe play and constantly checks for it safety. The output of the safety analysis is piped through llm integrations for human readable summaries. Then it uses various TA based indicators and ML methods to provide signals for trading opportunities. For notifying the signals we use telegram bots. Additional options on checking the integrity of the signals is also added, where performance for potential buys can be analysed and monitored.
